Narro really lowers the entry barrier to the software translation world by using a simple, intuitive interface and extensive checking to ensure that translation quality is kept high and people learn by translating, not by reading guidelines. I like to call it open translation because anyone can contribute, anyone can make better suggestions anytime and from anywhere. Translation maintainers benefit as well by pushing the changes to the versioning system or the other way around simply by pushing a button or executing a command.

# What is it? #

It's a web application that allows online software translation and coordination.

# About it #

  * it currently supports gettext, open office sdf files, mozilla dtd files and properties/ini files, dumb gettext files, svg and phpmyadmin
  * it's written in php and uses mysql as a database
  * it's built with [qcodo](http://www.qcodo.com) framework
  * it has spellchecking, entity checking and simple punctuation checking
  * it has plugins
  * translation suggestions are shared among the projects
  * users can vote their preferred suggestion
  * lots of permissions allow you to control the application
  * rss feeds for new texts to translate, new suggestions added and context information changes
  * it's growing fast
  * and much more waiting to be discovered or written about

# Why would you need it? #

Well there are other applications that do similar things. Right now, Narro is different because:

  * it's written for the translation communities, not for the project owners
  * it's written in php and mysql so it can be installed on any shared hosting
  * it's very simple to use, allowing everyone to contribute

Are you managing any translation right now? Multiply that number with ten. You could do ten times better than that! You just need to open your translations for everyone to contribute.

# About me #

I'm a translation coordinator for several projects. I'm working with my language, Romanian. Most of the translators we have are really technical people as I am. We don't all have high linguistic knowledge. I want to take the power to translate from these people and give it to all the users of the software to be translated. This application will grow as to become a place where people would like to return to translate. By making it this simple, I'm hoping that with this application you will have more software translated in less time. Quality is kept high through spellchecking, entity checking, punctuation checking, the fact that all that you translate is visible to anyone through a simple search operation and through a nice vote system.

# Where is it? #

On Mozilla servers, used for translating mozilla projects:

# Want to help? #

Say so in the [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/narro-project). You can help with PHP programming, testing the application and reporting issues or with web design. Narro supports themes, you know ? Some icon designs would be nice too.

If you don't know anything about development or design, you can <a href='http://narro-project.blogspot.com/'>donate</a> some money that will keep me off making money and allow me to spend more time developing Narro further.
