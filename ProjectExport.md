The export is done in a directory on the server.
After the export is finished, you will have a link to a zip archive that contains the translated project.

## Export translations using ##

In most cases, you will want to export the approved translation. But when you don't have translations approved, you have various options to export the unapproved translations along with the approved ones:

  * Approved, then most voted suggestion
  * Approved, then most recent suggestion
  * Approved, then most voted and then most recent suggestion
  * Approved, then my suggestion

The names are self-explaining.

## Copy unhandled files ##

The project might have some files that can't be translated in Narro, like a text file (.txt) that is still needed in the translation. You can check this option if you want to copy the files from the original ones. Note that if you already have the unhandled files in the directory used for the export they won't be overwritten. So you can translate manually the unhandled files and upload them once as they will be kept there.
