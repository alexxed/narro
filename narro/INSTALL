- extract the archive contents in your web server root directory. Or somwhere else if you prefer that.

- edit the file narro/includes/configuration.inc.php. You'll want to review the following settings:

    This is the email address where all aplication errors will be sent. Since this is a beta version, please be so kind and forward this reports to my email address.
        define('ADMIN_EMAIL_ADDRESS', 'user@host.com');

    If you're using a virtual directory like http://address/~user, fill in here /~user as value.
        define ('__VIRTUAL_DIRECTORY__', '');
        
    Define here the url to your server, http or https and server name.
        define ('__HTTP_URL__', 'http://localhost');

    Define here the subdirectory where Narro is located. If you extract the original archive under your web server root directory, then the subdirectory is /narro
        define ('__SUBDIRECTORY__', '/narro');

    Change your database settings accordingly, check server, port, database, username and password.
        define('DB_CONNECTION_1', serialize(array(
                'adapter' => 'MySqli5',
                'encoding' => 'UTF8',
                'server' => 'localhost',
                'port' => null,
                'database' => 'narro',
                'username' => 'narro',
                'password' => '',
                'profiling' => false)));

- import the file narro.sql in the database you are using.

    Make sure that the directory "data" under Narro's directory has 777 permissions (everyone can read, write and execute). If you extract the archive on a unix based system, the permissions are usually kept.

- head to http://server/__VIRTUAL_DIRECTORY__/__SUBDIRECTORY__. By default, it's http://hostname/narro.

    Narro should be working. 
    If so, create an account by clicking Register. 
    The first account will get super powers. Go to the link "Projects". 
    You'll have a project already defined, that's Narro. 
    Follow the "Manage" link besides it and do a first import from the page that opens. 
    It shouldn't take long. 
    After it's finished, click on "Narro" from the breadcrumbs to see the texts imported.
    Please visit the page http://code.google.com/p/narro/wiki/KnownIssues and add issues if you find any.
