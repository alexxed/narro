		It's difficult to debug PHP applications; while there are excellent
        PHP-level debugging mechanisms such as <a href="http://www.xdebug.org/">XDebug</a>,
        it is often hard to integrate these into your environment - perhaps,
        you are working on a shared host? Maybe you don't have root access to your
        server? In that case, many PHP developers resort to using methods such as<br>
        <div style="padding-left: 50px"><code>
            exit ("Processed fine up to here; variable value = " . $myVar);
        </code></div><br />
        
        We all know that these methods are rather limiting - in particular, when you
        are trying to debug advanced AJAX applications, such as QCubed apps. That's why
        we've included a better mechanism for debugging through Firebug:<br />
        
		<img src="qfirebug.png" alt="&quot;QFirebug Debugging Output&quot;" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br/>
        
        Here's how to make it work: install the following prerequisites in the order specified below:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/firefox/">Firefox</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843">Firebug</a> (Powerful Firefox extension for debugging)</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.firephp.org/">FirePHP</a> (Firebug extension for PHP debugging)</li>
        </ul>
        
        Then, come back to this page and open and enable the Firebug console by going
        to <i>Tools | Firebug | Enable Firebug</i> in the Firefox menu. Make sure that the
        Console, Script, and Net panels are enabled in Firebug.<br /><br />
        
        You can then use the <b>QFirebug</b> static class to output your debugging
        messages to the Firebug console. You can expect the standard <b>log()</b>
        methods - review the effects by clicking Button A below. It's also really
        easy to output the queries (database profile) into the console by using
        <b>QFirebug::OutputDatabaseProfile()</b>. Remember that you need to first
        enable the profiling for your database for it to work - see this in
        action by clicking Button B below.
